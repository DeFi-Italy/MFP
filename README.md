Melon Funding Proposals

Teams and projects applying for a funding through the Melon inflation pool must submit their application by making a pull request to this repository. Make a PR with a file named your_project.md and detail the following: 

- Description of the project 
- Synergies/benefits to the Melon ecosystem
- Clear timeline
- Funding needs
- Team presentation
- Contact information

The more detailed the better. If your submission is long, please make sure to include an executive summary. The Melon Council will review the applications submitted here and get back to you with further questions.
